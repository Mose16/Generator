# Generator
Pseudo code generator, not 100% perfect so go through it and correct things you want to fix.

For example a common glitch is 
    Set variable 'return dict(user' to logged_user) and dict(books_list = books)
Simply cut the first part to the "="
    return dict(Set variable 'user' to logged_user) and dict(books_list = books)
